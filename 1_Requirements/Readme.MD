## INTRODUCTION
In Python requirement.txt file is a type of file that usually stores information about all the libraries, modules, and packages in itself that are used while developing a particular project. It also stores all files and packages on which that project is dependent or requires to run. Typically this file "requirement.txt" is stored (or resides) in the root directory of your projects. Here another essential question arises why we need this type of file in our projects.  

A requirement.txt files include all types of the standard packages and libraries that are used in that particular project. Therefore this requirement.txt file plays an essential role while developing any small or bigger projects. It also helps us make our projects more portable.

## Objective 

One of the most important functions that you will need to use as you work with files in Python is open(),write(),and append() ,a built-in function that open,write, and append a file and allows your program to use it and work with it.

## Advantage 

1.Reusability: It helps in preserving the data or information generated after running the program.   
2.Large storage capacity: Using files, you need not worry about the problem of storing data in bulk.   
3.Saves time: There are certain programs that require a lot of input from the user. You can easily access any part of the code with the help of certain commands.   
4.Portability: You can easily transfer the contents of a file from one computer system to another without having to worry about the loss of data.   

## Disadvantages

1.Data Redundancy:. It is possible that the same information may be duplicated in different files.this leads to data redundancy results in memory wastage.  
2.Data Inconsistency:. Because of data redundancy,it is possible that data may not be in consistent state.  
3.Difficulty in Accessing Data:. Accessing data is not convenient and efficient in file processing system.  

## Strength

1.Reusability  
2.Large storage capacity
3.Time consumption
4.Portability

## Weakness

1.Data Redundancy
2.Data Inconsistency
3.Difficulty in Accessing Data

## Opportunities

## fgetc:
It is used to read single character from the file.

## fputc:
It is used to write a single character in the file.

## fputw:
It is used to write an integer in the file.

## fgetw:
It is used to read an integer from the file.

## fscanf:
It is used to read formatted data (like integer, char, float etc) from the file.

## fprintf:
It is used to write formatted data (like integer, char, float etc) in the file.

 ## fwrite:
It is used to write mixed data (structure) in the file.

## fread:
It is used to read mixed data (structure) from the file.

## Threats

1.All variables used in a program are kept in the main memory and they are volatile, i.e., their values are lost when the program ends.
2.Even if you write a program running forever, your data will be lost in case of a shutdown or a power failure.
